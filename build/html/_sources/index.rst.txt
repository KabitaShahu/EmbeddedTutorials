Embedded Tutorial documentation
===============================

In this **Embedded Tutorial**, you will learn about **Embedded programming**, **Kinematics**, **Control Algorithm**, **filters**, **error detection and correction**, some useful maths and other many things. There are lots of topic to learn in this subject. Being interested in **Electronics**, it is essential to have knowledge about it.

Basic Topics in the Embedded Programming that we learn are:

- GPIO
- Interrupts
- Timers
- UART
- I2C
- SPI
- USB Serial


We also learn about:

- Actuator Control (DC Motor, Servo, BLDC, Pneumatic)
- Kinematics used for Robot
- PID
- CRC
- Filters
