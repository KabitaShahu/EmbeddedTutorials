**Embedded Systems** play a crucial role in electronic devices, control systems, and **robotics**. They are composed of two primary components: **hardware and software**. The hardware forms the physical foundation of the system, while the software consists of the programs that operate on it. Common programming languages for embedded systems include **Embedded C, C++, and Python**. The performance, efficiency, and durability of an embedded system are heavily influenced by its design and implementation.
